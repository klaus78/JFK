/* 
 * JFK - Java Function Kernel
 *
 * This project provides a run-time framework to achieve functional programming
 * in Java. The idea is to have the capability to get something similar to function pointers
 * and C# delegates in Java, doing all the bindings and reference resolution at run-time being able,
 * at the same time, being able to compile the program using a function-first-class entity and abstraction.
